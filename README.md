21. WHEN ASSITING IN CODING MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IN THE LASTEST DOCUMENTATION ARE SAME

When coding do consider these rules below:
 Rule: Every line of code must be flawless. Any bug, however small, is unacceptable. 
 Rule: Only necessary code is allowed. Avoid any redundancy or inefficiency.
 Rule: Code must be clear and easy to understand by any future developer. Avoid obscure logic or ambiguous design.
 Rule: Consider all potential input scenarios, including rare edge cases.
 Rule: Code must be optimized for speed and resource efficiency.
 Rule: Design for resilience and security. If something goes wrong, the system should handle failures gracefully.
 Rule: Document every aspect of the system thoroughly.
 Rule: Assume each error will have severe consequences. Review code continuously to meet the strictest standards.
 Rule: Your system will face intense scrutiny. Anticipate and prevent breaches.
 Rule: Maintain secure, environment-specific settings.

## best prompt universal AI recommended to build a very good projects that works 
```
I want to build a Python [type of app: web API, web app, CLI tool, desktop app, data pipeline, etc.].

MVP Goal: [One sentence: what the app must do at its simplest to be considered usable].

Platform: [Web API / Web app / CLI / Desktop / Mobile backend / Batch job].

Top 3 Features:

[Feature 1]

[Feature 2]

[Feature 3]

Constraints: [Python version, required frameworks, DB choice, vendor lock-in, compliance needs].

Users: [Who will use it, their technical level, expected usage scale].

Non-functional Requirements: [Performance targets, offline mode, reliability, response time, security level].

Integration Needs: [Any APIs, data sources, authentication providers; or state “None for MVP”].

Deployment Target: [Local use, Docker, cloud provider, serverless, etc.].

Testing & Quality: [Unit tests only, or include integration/load tests, code coverage targets].

Future Considerations (Optional): [Features you want later but not in MVP].
```

### one liner that keep working

```
Build a Python [app type] that [main goal]; MVP = [single must-have outcome]; platform = [web/CLI/desktop/etc.]; features = [3 bullets]; constraints = [Python version, frameworks/DB]; users = [who & scale]; non-functional = [performance/security]; deployment = [local/cloud/etc.].
```
